    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    The Product Owner formed user stories based on the wants and needs of the user. These user stories are then used as a roadmap to move forward in the development of the product.
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    When developing programs you must work as a team to accomplish the goals of the product. Agile assists the development process by allowing the team to fullly understand and accomplish the needs of the user. Agile allows for changes to be made to a product in later stages when the user's needs change or are updated.  
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    In order to be a good team member in software development you must be able to be transparent and good at communication. You must take responsibility for your role in the team, hold your teammates accountable for their roles, and pass on knowledge when able.
